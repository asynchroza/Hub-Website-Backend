JUNE 20th 2022: 
- Added password validation which returns (on 200) an env AUTH_TOKEN for validating requests
- Changed CreateMember (POST req) to accept a header for the BEARER_TOKEN (AUTH_TOKEN)
- Changed Member model to accept a profile picture http link (as a string)

JUNE 21th 2022:
- Added POST req in Admin route for BEARER_TOKEN verification (to be used as a validator for entering a routed page where verification is needed)

June 22th 2022:
- Added MemberID (string) to member model (to be used for easy retrieval of member) (stored as memberid in DB)
- Added GetMember (GET request) which accepts member_id as "key" (string) (/api/member/$key) -> does not work with ?key=, returns user_info as "data"
- Added EditMember (PUT request, hence when provided with new information it edits the member's fields) which accepts normal member body, BEARER_TOKEN at /api/member/$key 
- Added DeleteMember (DELETE request) which acts pretty much the same as GET member except it deletes the member and needs BEARER_TOKEN authorization

June 23th 2022:
- Implemented Events model
- Added POST req for creating an Event (eventid, title, startdate (ISO), enddate (ISO), description, location, locationlink, banner) - needs authorization -> comments in events_models
